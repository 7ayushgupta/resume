# Resume

Git repository with my updated resume.

## How to Use

### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is required. To install TeX Live:
```
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```

### Usage

To compile the  [`cv.tex`](cv.tex) file, run:
```
xelatex cv.tex
```

This should result in the creation of [`cv.pdf`](cv.pdf)

## Credits

[Latex](http://www.latex-project.org/) is a fantastic typesetting program that a lot of people use these days, and this template is based on [AwesomeCV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV), `a LaTeX template for the outstanding job application`
